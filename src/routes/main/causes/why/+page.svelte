            Reason 1: Global Warming
        </span>

        <p class="text-white">
            Global warming is the process in which greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth's atmosphere, causing a warming effect which in turn increases the average global temperature. An example of an animal affected by this is the <strong>corals</strong> in the great barrier reef. the excess CO2 causes

            Reason 2: Habitat Destruction
        </span>

        <p class="text-white">
            With the destruction of habitats, animals have no place to go, or hide from predators. this leads to them being hunted and their numbers going down, leading to an imbalance in the ecosystem. For example, the <strong>Koala</strong> is a species whose habitat is being destroyed (eucalyptus forests) and is at risk of extinction in the near future.

            Reason 3: Invasive species
        </span>

        <p class="text-white">
            The introduction of an external species into an environment destroys local ecosystems, putting entire species at risk of extinction, possibly bringing the entire food web down with it. An example of this is the current <strong>rabbit</strong> crisis in Australia, as rabbits were introduced into the land there and they have multiplied in number, putting some other species at risk.

        This map shows the amount of biodiversity loss in different places around the globe. In Australia, you can clearly see that places like the outback have largely intact ecosystems, due to the fact that they haven't been urbanised. Places on the outside however, have been organised and their ecosystems are 50% gone, meaning they are at major risk of collapse.
